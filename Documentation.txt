pos_offset(x offset, y offset, object) - adds the offsets to each axis

txt_align(x alignment, y alignment, text object) - centers text based on the two alignment operators

center_on(obj to be centered, center frame, offset) - centers an object on another with an applied offset

add_to_scene(window, sprites) - Adds all sprites given

rotate(degrees) - Sets a sprites angle to a set position 


Class: Movement(Movement speed)

  Attributes
  Movement.ms - The speed at wich the object will move (int)

  Movement.mkdict - A dictionary used to apply x and y offsets to an object

  Movement.mklist - A list of all keys that can be pressed (Arrow keys)

  Movement.dirlist - A dictionary of all directions described by strings ‘up’,  ‘down’,  ‘left’,  ‘right’ and their offsets

  Methods
  Movement.arrow_move(sprite) - Applies movement to the object provided

  Movement.spin(speed, sprite) - Rotates the object at a set speed

Example Script:
		import tsapp
		import tsapp_helper as h
	
		window = tsapp.GrapicsWindow()

		mover = h.Movement(5)
		obj1 = tsapp.Sprite(‘filler.png’, 100, 100) 
h.add_to_scene(window, obj1)

while window.is_running:
	window.finish_frame()
	mover.arrow_move(obj1)
	mover.spin(3, obj1)


This script will add ‘filler.png’ into the scene and it will spin to the left at the speed 3, you can move the png around the scene by using the arrow keys.
